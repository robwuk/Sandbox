          <h2> Welcome </h2>

          <p class="first">Welcome <span id="name"></span> to my Sandbox. This is where I try out new processes from courses, experiment or test out new ways of doing things. The state of the page myay be a mess but it allows me to trial things without affecting main sites. Work here may (or may not) make its way on to other sites I use. <br /><br /> As this site is a testbed, it may be worth your while to check back regularly.

        <section id="Current Work">
          <h2>Current Areas Under Development</h2>
          <p>I am currently working on the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Entering data via JS prompts (you were asked for your name when the page loaded</li>
              <li>returning values to web pages (if you entered a name it will display in the "Welcome" section)</li>
              <li>using JS to modify DOM elements (adding new ones, changing colour etc)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            The results of any areas I am evolving will be displayed in the "Work Area" below
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="AreasOfInterest">
          <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
          <p>From the lessons/experiments etc. I am looking at there are a number of areas that I would like to explore:
            <ul>
              <li>Reading text from a file to populate page sections</li>
              <li>Reading .CSV files in and populating an array</li>
              <li>Using an array to build up a table in HTML - <b>DONE</b></li>
              <li>"Contact Me" form</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <section id="Work Area">
          <h2>Work Area</h2>
          <p>This is the area that houses the under development activities (or a link to a development page if I have had to start a new page due to size/complexity of development).
          </p>
          <div id="demo1">some text - colour gets changed to RED if you say "YES" to colour change</div>
          <br />
          <div id="demo2">This is the original text... some more should be below</div>
          <div>This should have a list generated from JS:<br /><ul id="list"></ul></div>
