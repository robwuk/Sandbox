          <p class="first">Welcome <span id="name"></span> to my Sandbox. This is where I try out new processes from courses, experiment or test out new ways of doing things. The state of the page myay be a mess but it allows me to trial things without affecting main sites. Work here may (or may not) make its way on to other sites I use. <br /><br /> As this site is a testbed, it may be worth your while to check back regularly.

        <section id="Current Work">
          <h2>Current Areas Under Development</h2>
          <p>I am currently working on the following:
            <ul>
              <li>using JS to modify DOM elements (adding new ones, changing colour etc)</li>
              <li>event handlers</a>.
            </ul>
            <br />
            The results of any areas I am evolving will be displayed in the "Work Area" below
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="AreasOfInterest">
          <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
          <p>From the lessons/experiments etc. I am looking at there are a number of areas that I would like to explore:
            <ul>
              <li>Reading text from a file to populate page sections</li>
              <li>Reading .CSV files in and populating an array</li>
              <li>Using an array to build up a table in HTML - <b>DONE</b></li>
              <li>"Contact Me" form</li>
            </ul>
